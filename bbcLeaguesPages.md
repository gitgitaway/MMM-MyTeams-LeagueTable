## Usage with MMM-MyTeams-LeagueTable

To add any of these leagues to your MagicMirror configuration, follow these steps:

### 1. Update your config.js

Add the new league to your module configuration:

```javascript
{
    module: "MMM-MyTeams-LeagueTable",
    position: "bottom_left",
    config: {
        // Your existing configuration
        // ...
        
        // Add a new league (example for Serie A)
        showSerieA: true,
        
        // Update league headers
        leagueHeaders: {
            // Your existing headers
            "SPFL": "SPFL Premiership",
            "UCL": "UEFA Champions League",
            "UEL": "UEFA Europa League",
            "ECL": "UEFA Europa Conference League",
            // Add the new league header
            "SerieA": "Italian Serie A"
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Update the Module Code

You'll need to modify the module's JavaScript file to support the new league:

1. Open `MMM-MyTeams-LeagueTable.js`
2. Add the new league to the initialization in the `start` function:

```javascript
// Initialize variables
this.leagueData = {
    SPFL: null,
    UCL: null,
    UEL: null,
    ECL: null,
    SerieA: null  // Add your new league
};
this.loaded = {
    SPFL: false,
    UCL: false,
    UEL: false,
    ECL: false,
    SerieA: false  // Add your new league
};
```

3. Add the data request in the `requestAllLeagueData` function:

```javascript
if (this.config.showSerieA) {
    this.sendSocketNotification("GET_LEAGUE_DATA", {
        ...this.config,
        leagueType: "SerieA",
        url: "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/italian-serie-a/table"
    });
}
```

4. Update the `scheduleCycling` function to include the new league:

```javascript
// Create array of enabled leagues
this.enabledLeagues = [];
if (this.config.showSPFL) this.enabledLeagues.push("SPFL");
if (this.config.showUCL) this.enabledLeagues.push("UCL");
if (this.config.showUEL) this.enabledLeagues.push("UEL");
if (this.config.showECL) this.enabledLeagues.push("ECL");
if (this.config.showSerieA) this.enabledLeagues.push("SerieA");  // Add your new league
```

5. Add a button for the new league in the `getDom` function:

```javascript
if (this.config.showSerieA) {
    var serieABtn = document.createElement("button");
    serieABtn.className = "league-btn" + (this.currentLeague === "SerieA" ? " active" : "");
    serieABtn.textContent = "Serie A";
    serieABtn.dataset.league = "SerieA";
    serieABtn.addEventListener("click", this.handleLeagueButtonClick.bind(this));
    buttonsContainer.appendChild(serieABtn);
}
```

## Notes

- BBC Sport occasionally updates their URL structure, so these links may change over time.
- Some competitions may only show tables during the active season.
- Cup competitions typically don't have league tables but may have group stages with standings.
- The module caches league data to ensure smooth transitions between leagues.
- Not all URLs in this document may be active at all times, as BBC Sport may only provide tables for ongoing competitions.
- For the best performance, limit the number of enabled leagues to 3-4 at a time.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with a specific league table:

1. Verify the URL is correct by visiting it in a browser
2. Check if the competition is currently in season
3. Inspect the browser console for any errors
4. Try increasing the `retryDelay` and `maxRetries` values in your configuration
